  crisis management structure for sensitive incidents has been
  highlighted.

- **Modernized Language:** The language has been updated to reflect
  current best practices in cybersecurity incident response.

By following these strategies, tactics, steps, and procedures,
organizations can effectively contain cyber network attacks, minimize
their impact, and improve their overall security posture.

## Eradication from Network behaviour

Objective: Take actions to stop the malicious behaviour.

- **Block the source**

  - Using analysis of identification and containment stages, find out
    all communication channels used by the attacker and block them on
    all your network boundaries.

  - If source is an insider, take appropriate actions, and involve your
    Management/HR/Legal team.

  - If source is an external offender, consider involvinabuse teams and
    law enforcement services if required.

- **Technical remediation**

  - Define a remediation process. If necessary, this process can be
    validated by another structure, like your incident response team for
    example.

  - Remediation steps from intrusion IRM can also be useful.

- **Test and enforce**

  - Test the remediation process and make sure that it properly works
    without damaginany service.

  - Enforce the remediation process once tests have been approved by
    both IT and business.

Objective: Take actions to stop the malicious behaviour.

 

Are there additional IDS/IPS segments that need coverage to
prevent/detect outbreak?

Ban malicious MD5 or SHA2 hashes with whitelisting tool or other
relevant product.

Block command and control IP addresses at network perimeter.

Block malicious IP addresses and file hashes.

Monitor RDP sessions on external accessible RDP client system.

Review firewall logs and identify any weaknesses.

## Recovery from Network attack

All these steps shall be made in a step-by-step manner and with a
technical monitoring.

Ensure that the network traffic is back to normal

Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.

Re-allow the network traffic that was used as a propagation method by
the attacker

Reconnect sub-areas together if necessary

Reconnect the area to the Internet if necessary

Reconnect the area to your local network if necessary

Tighten perimeter security and zero trust access rules.

Update boundary access control lists.

Update Firewall rules
