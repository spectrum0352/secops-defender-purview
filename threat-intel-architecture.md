# Summary
The Threat Intelligence Architecture defines how threat intelligence is collected, processed, analyzed, and operationalized across the enterprise security ecosystem.
It enables:
•	Intelligence-driven SOC operations
•	Risk-based decision-making
•	Proactive threat mitigation

3. Objectives
Strategic
•	Align intelligence with business risk and threat landscape
•	Support executive cyber risk decisions
Operational
•	Improve detection and response efficiency
•	Enable intelligence-led SOC
Technical
•	Integrate intelligence across SIEM, SOAR, and EDR/XDR
•	Automate intelligence ingestion and enrichment

4. Scope
In Scope
•	Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)
•	SIEM, SOAR, EDR/XDR integrations
•	External and internal intelligence sources
•	Threat hunting and incident response
Out of Scope
•	Physical security intelligence
•	Non-cyber intelligence domains
